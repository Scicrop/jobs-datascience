# Descripton

This is a quick jab at the technical stage of the [SciCrop](https://scicrop.com/?lang=en "SciCrop's Homepage") selection process
As I had only 5 hours on the deadline date to work on this project (the week before the deadline was a rly busy one) the aproach was quick and lean, without much of EDA and most of the time trying to make sense of the data and the problem (as +- 1 hour was used to write the markdown text)

The README describing the problem can be found on 'Test_repo_Readme' directory.

In the end this will be on my github and eventualy part of a portfolio (at this moment still getting the hang of data science), so I will continue this project on a latter date (the README is in portuguese, but will translate it to english when I get back to it).

The notebook presents how I started exploring the problem and the dataset.
